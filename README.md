**Explore US Bikeshare Data**
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. This project focused on using Git and GitHub with a simulated workflow to refactor Project 2. The submission requirement is to include the update of the documenentation and the comments used to perform the reiqested tasks.
